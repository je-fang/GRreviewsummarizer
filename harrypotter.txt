Here's the Written Review!

Can you hear me screaming?

As expected, the illustrations brought this book to a whole new level. I legitimately want to buy another copy, solely to take it apart and frame it.

Each page is just bursting with new life. Honestly, how could you not love such beautiful images?

Hogwarts, Hogwarts. Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.

I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.

Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit of an odd child - much to his family's dismay.

Things just... happened ...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.

On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him and a whole new world opens in front of his eyes.

In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.

The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.

Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book. Just look at these images - they're magnificent:

Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!

Not only are these full-color, high quality images but there are so many of them.

Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There's pages and pages of pictures like this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.

Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one. If you haven't read HP recently...I strongly urge you to check out this book.

¶I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*
I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting.
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)

FAVORITE QUOTE: "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

My reviews of other titles in this series:

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
¶My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It "ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport."

There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.
I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all.

Original review (circa 2010)
A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate:
Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better.
Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort,
That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's
That Edward is cooler than Harry,
and Bella is smarter than Hermione.
Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling.

Go ahead, I dare you.

Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid.

Quite frankly-this book is amazing.
